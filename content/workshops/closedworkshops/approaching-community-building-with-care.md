  In this workshop, we’ll explore care-based approaches to community building.
  We’ll discuss what a care-based approach looks like in creating intentional
  online and offline community spaces. We’ll facilitate a workshop activity that
  encourages participants to reflect on what community care looks like in the
  context of their art practice or research project for the Virtual Grounds
  program.
