Over the course of a year, we will survey how technology continues to grow and impact our lives in different ways through a series of workshops led by practicing creative technologists, scholars, and artists.\r\n\r\nThis year we will be focusing on the theme of Platforms. We understand that everyone has a different interpretation of platforms and what it means to them. We will be focusing on social/technology based platforms, how they shape our lives, our imagination and how we move through virtual spaces. Our themes are used as guideposts on how you build your project and what questions you want to explore, it is adaptable to your own explorations and experiences. Over the course of this program we will be expanding our ideas of ‘platforms’ through workshops, readings and building together. \r\n\r\n**The call for applications will open August 20th, 2021 until September 17th. Successful applicants will be notified by October 1st. The program will begin October 2021 through to the end of 2022. This year, our program will be entirely remote – we welcome applications from anywhere in Canada.**\r\n\r\nWhen we began this initiative in 2019 we wanted to create a space for artists and researchers to explore their relationship with technology and how it shaped our urban and rural environments. Through a series of in-person and virtual workshops participants were able to expand their knowledge about the everyday intersections with technology. With the support of their mentors and staff, each participant was able to build out a project that helped them answer a set of questions around their relationship to technology. Check out their amazing projects [here](showcase.virtualgrounds.zone).  \r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## About this program\r\n\r\n\"Virtual Grounds: Platforms” is a three-part online training and remote research initiative dedicated to navigating our experiences within virtual spaces and our relationship to surveillance and privacy. This program will support the study and dissemination of our understanding of digital rights within virtual spaces and how that intersects with the arts. \r\n\r\nThe training phase will include a 12-week co-created online curriculum, when the participants have access to technical capacity building opportunities and professional mentorship. During the research phase, participants will conduct focused research on the topic of their choosing, working towards a publication. The last phase will be the knowledge dissemination component which will support increasing broader digital literacy through the research interventions provided by participants.\r\n\r\n**Objectives**\r\n\r\n* Participants will build technical and critical capacity around the impact of digital technologies and how to re-shape digital futures.\r\n* Participants will gain knowledge and experience around digital rights, data visualization, game design, narrative building, and/or using technology to build art.\r\n* Each participant will work on an independent research project of their choosing which will be presented on an online, trans-media publication. Each project should take shape as or include a written or text-based format; creative components and creation are encouraged, but not necessary. \r\n\r\n**Selected researchers receive:**\r\n\r\n* Full access to all training sessions of the 12-week curriculum.\r\n* A $2000 professional research fee to participate in the combined training and research phases.\r\n* A production allowance for the publication and independent research phase.\r\n* A mentor of their choosing to help guide research objectives and support technical development.\r\n* A complimentary, one-year production membership to Trinity Square Video\r\n\r\n**Participants Profile**\r\n\r\nWe are looking for 15 emerging artists and creative technologists.
