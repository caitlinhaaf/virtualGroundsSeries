While data justice has challenged the nonconsensual use of data in surveillance practices, policing, and racial profiling, environmental justice movements often call for increased, open, and participatory data in order to document environmental racism and inequality. The EDJ Working Group recognizes the many conflicting justice concerns that data manifests and aims to bring together research communities to struggle together across these differences with a commitment to intersectional justice. </p>\n<p>Michelle Murphy is the Director of the Technoscience Research Unit, and Canada Research Chair in Science and Technology Studies and Environmental Data Justice.</p>"}
